Exercise 2: Write a C program to check whether a given number is even or odd.

	Please enter a number:
	6
	The number is even
--------------------------------------------------------
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   /*How do you know if a number is even or odd ?
If a number is evenly divisible by 2 with no remainder,then it is even.
You can calculate the remainder with the modulo operator % like this num % 2 == 0 .
If a number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1, then the number is odd.*/

printf("this program tells you if the number you entered is even or odd\n");
printf("please enter a number(make sure it's integer)\n");
int number;
scanf("%d",&number);
int r;
r=number%2;
 if(cl==0)
        {printf("this number is even");}
   if(cl!=0)
       {printf("this number is odd");}

                   return 0;}
